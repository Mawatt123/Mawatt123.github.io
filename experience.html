        <h2>Accenture: 07/09/2022 - Present</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently (as of 14/09/2022) being trained by Accenture to fulfil my role of Associate Software Engineer. As a technical consulting firm, Accenture helps clients improve various technical elements of their business. My role will require me to understand clients expectations, set clear precise goals, and then develop, test and deploy a software solution. We will be working primarily using an agile methodology, but if the client wishes we will work with a waterfall methodology.

          When I finished my degree I chose to complete some online courses to develop my knowledge of various computer science areas. The website Codeacademy offers courses on a wide array of programming languages. I completed the courses on C#, HTML5, and CSS. I also got halfway through the online Introduction to Computer Science Course offered by Harvard. This was great to get a more formal introduction to the field. I hope to finish this course when I find more time.

          I am aware this provides merely surface level knowledge, most knowledge comes from practical experience. For this reason I used visual studio, C#, and XAML to make a calculator app that works on android phones. This project was somewhat succesful, if I had more time I would iron out some of the bugs. For example, displaying error messages when receiving incorrect input rather than just breaking.

          To practice my HTML5 and CSS skills, I chose to develop the exact website you are browsing right now.

        <p>
          This was my first job. I was responsible for pouring drinks and serving food. It taught me a lot of patience and customer service skills.
