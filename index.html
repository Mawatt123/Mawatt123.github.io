              <p class="intro">
              I am Matt and I was born in Banbury, UK in the year 2000. I lived in Banbury until I was 8, then I moved to a town called Kenilworth. At the age of 11 my family and I moved to Alcester and I attended Alcester Grammar School. I studied my GCSEs and A-Levels here. I then studied an Integrated Master of Mathematics course at Durham University. On the 30th June 2022 I graduate from Durham University with 1st class honours. That summer I spent 2 weeks travelling the West Coast of the USA with my friends. At the start of September 2022, I began work as an Associate Software Engineer with Accenture based in Newcastle.  </p>
