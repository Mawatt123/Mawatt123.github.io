          <h2>Durham University</h2>
          <p>
          I studied mathematics at Durham for 4 years. On the 30th June 2022 I graduated with first class honours. 
          </p>
          <h2>Dissertation</h2>
          <p>
          In my final year, I completed my dissertation titled "Modelling the Spread of a Coronavirus". This project was immensely interesting, particularly as I was working on it whilst COVID-19 was rampant throughout the UK. The future was very uncertain at this time, this made my dissertation feel of great importance. The project introduces simple mathematical models that split the population into groups based on criteria such as if they are susceptible/infected/recovered. It discusses and anlayses how the population should move between these classes. I build on these fundamental models gradually until I am working with very complex models. In particular, some of these complex models explore how the effects of the virus vary with respect to age. Also I explore the importance of vaccination throughout the population. Using Python, I recreate these models in a form such that I can generate useful graphs. These graphs can be used to predict future trends in the spread of the virus, this enables us to take counteractive measures.

          <h2>University Modules</h2>
          <p>
          My mathematics degree exposed me to a broad array of topics. I have studied lots of physics modules such as: Quantum Computing, General Relativity, Advanced Quantum Theory. As you can imagine, I have also studied lots of pure maths. Examples include: Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Elementary Number Theory, Codes and Cryptography.

          <h2>A-Levels</h2>
          <p>
          For my A-Levels I earned: Mathematics - A*, Further Mathematics - A*, Physics - A.
          </p>
          <h2>GCSEs</h2>
          <p>
          For my GCSEs I earned: 4A*, 5A, 2B.
