        <h2>Painting</h2>
        <p>
          I really enjoy painting. I appreciate how it engages a different part of my brain than Maths and Software Engineering. At the next opportunity I hope to get photos of some of my paintings to upload below.

        <h2>Fitness</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy working out. I find it to be a good way to relieve stress, the benefits for my body are a nice bonus.

        <h2>Chess</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy playing chess online. Satisfying to make plans and see their rewards.

        <h2>Socialising</h2>
        <p>
          I love hanging out with my friends at the pub. Alternatively playing video games with them is also good fun!
